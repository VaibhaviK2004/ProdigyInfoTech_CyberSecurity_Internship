# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

This is a simple Python program that performs **encryption and decryption** using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**, created as part of the **Cyber Security Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 📌 Features

- Encrypt messages by shifting letters
- Decrypt messages with a given shift
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores and preserves special characters and spaces

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number (shift value).  
For example, a shift of `3` turns `A` into `D`, `B` into `E`, and so on.
